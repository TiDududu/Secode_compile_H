Primary functionality: This contract is for a token called "Zapit" and includes standard ERC20 token functions. It also has additional functions for distributing tokens, destroying the contract, and handling Ether transactions.

1. totalSupply, returns the total supply of tokens.
2. balanceOf, returns the token balance of a specified address.
3. transfer, transfers tokens to a specified address.
4. transferFrom, transfers tokens from one address to another.
5. approve, allows a spender to withdraw from the owner's account multiple times, up to the approved amount.
6. allowance, returns the remaining number of tokens that a spender is allowed to withdraw.
7. destroycontract, self-destructs the contract and sends any remaining Ether to the specified address.
8. distributeTokens, distributes tokens to a specified address.
9. approveAndCall, approves the spender and calls the receiveApproval function on the spender's contract.

The "Zapit" contract inherits from the "StandardToken" contract and initializes the token with specific details such as name, symbol, total supply, etc. It also includes a fallback function to handle Ether transactions and token transfers.

You need to be cautious when using the destroycontract function as it self-destructs the contract and sends any remaining Ether to the specified address.
