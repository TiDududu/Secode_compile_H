Primary functionality: The contract implements the functionality of a self-sustaining pyramid scheme that allows users to convert Ether into tokens and vice-versa.

1. balanceOf, Returns the number of tokens currently held by the specified address (_owner).
2. withdraw, Withdraws all dividends held by the caller, updates global variables, and transfers Ether back to the caller.
3. reinvestDividends, Converts the Ether accrued as dividends back into EPY tokens without withdrawing it first. Saves on gas and potential price spike loss.
