Primary functionality: This contract allows for transferring Ether in two parts to a specified address.

1. transfer, This function takes an address as input and splits the value sent with the transaction into two halves. It then sends each half to the specified address.
2. fallback function, This function is a fallback function that is triggered when the contract receives Ether without any specific function call. It reverts the transaction.

Note: The code uses the deprecated `send` function, which is not recommended for value transfers.
