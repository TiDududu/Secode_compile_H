Primary functionality: This contract implements an ERC20 token called Bitway with the symbol "BTW" and the name "Bitway". It includes functions to create tokens, check total supply and balances, transfer tokens, approve token transfers, and check allowances.

1. totalSupply, returns the total supply of Bitway tokens.
2. balanceOf, returns the balance of a specified address.
3. transfer, transfers tokens from the sender's address to a specified address.
4. transferFrom, allows a third party to transfer tokens from one address to another.
5. approve, allows a spender to withdraw from the sender's account multiple times, up to the approved amount.
6. allowance, checks the amount of tokens that an owner has approved for a spender to withdraw.

Additionally, the contract includes a constructor function to set the owner of the contract and a fallback function to create tokens when Ether is sent to the contract. The SafeMath library is used for arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow.
