4. allowance: Checks the amount of tokens that an owner allowed to a spender.
5. transfer: Transfers tokens to a specified address and performs an airdrop check before the transfer.
6. approve: Approves the passed address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of the message sender.

Note: The SafeMath library is used for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows.
