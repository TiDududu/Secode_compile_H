2. query_withGasLimit, Initiates a query to the Oraclize service with a specified timestamp, datasource, argument, and gas limit.
3. query2, Initiates a query to the Oraclize service with a specified timestamp, datasource, and two arguments.
4. query2_withGasLimit, Initiates a query to the Oraclize service with a specified timestamp, datasource, two arguments, and gas limit.
5. queryN, Initiates a query to the Oraclize service with a specified timestamp, datasource, and multiple arguments.
6. queryN_withGasLimit, Initiates a query to the Oraclize service with a specified timestamp, datasource, multiple arguments, and gas limit.
7. getPrice, Retrieves the price for a specified datasource.
8. getPrice, Retrieves the price for a specified datasource with a specified gas limit.
9. useCoupon, Uses a coupon code for Oraclize service.
