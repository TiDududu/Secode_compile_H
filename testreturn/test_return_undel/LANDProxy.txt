4. ProxyStorage, stores the current contract being proxied.
5. Storage, inherits from ProxyStorage, OwnableStorage, AssetRegistryStorage, and LANDStorage to combine all storage functionalities.
6. DelegateProxy, provides functions for delegate calls and checking if an address is a contract.
7. IApplication, defines an interface for initializing an application.
8. Proxy, allows for upgrading the underlying logic contract and delegates calls to the current contract.
