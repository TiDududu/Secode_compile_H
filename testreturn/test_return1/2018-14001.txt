Primary functionality: This Solidity code defines a token contract with transfer, approve, and batch transfer functionalities, along with a trading contract and a token sale contract.

1. transfer, Allows the sender to transfer tokens to a specified address.
2. transferFrom, Allows a designated address to transfer tokens on behalf of the sender.
3. approve, Allows the sender to approve a designated address to spend a specified amount of tokens on their behalf.
4. batchTransfer, Allows the sender to transfer a specified amount of tokens to multiple addresses in a single transaction.
5. Trade, Enables the exchange of tokens between two addresses at a specified price, with the involvement of managers.
6. Shark, Initializes the token with a name, symbol, total supply, and assigns the total supply to the contract creator. It also includes functions for changing the token price, buying and selling tokens, airdropping tokens, and cashing out funds.

The "Shark" contract inherits functionalities from the "Traded" contract, which in turn inherits functionalities from the "ExtendedToken" contract, which itself inherits functionalities from the "StandardToken" contract. The "Shark" contract also includes modifiers for only allowing human interaction and restricting certain functions to the contract owner.
