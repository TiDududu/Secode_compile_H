Primary functionality: This contract is a part of a challenge where the objective is to guess a random number. The contract contains functions for initializing the challenge, checking if the challenge is complete, and submitting a guess for the random number.

1. GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge
   - This is the constructor function that initializes the contract and sets the answer by hashing the block hash and current timestamp.

2. isComplete
   - This function is a view function that returns a boolean indicating whether the challenge is complete, i.e., if the contract balance is 0.

3. guess
   - This function allows a player to submit a guess for the random number by providing a uint8 input. If the guess matches the answer, the player receives 2 ether as a reward.

Note: The contract is vulnerable to a randomness manipulation attack, as mentioned in the comments.
