The AffiliateList contract manages affiliates by allowing the owner to set their start and end timestamps, and check if an address is in the affiliate list as of a specific time. The InvestorList contract manages investors by allowing the owner to add addresses with specific roles, retrieve the role of an address, and check if an address has a specific role. Both contracts inherit from the Ownable contract, which provides functionality for changing ownership of the contract.
