Primary functionality: This Solidity contract is designed to create an ERC20 token with the ability to mint new tokens, transfer tokens between addresses, and approve spending of tokens by another address.

1. ERC20Basic - This is an interface defining the basic ERC20 token functions, including totalSupply, balanceOf, and transfer.

2. SafeMath Library - A library providing safe mathematical operations to prevent overflows and underflows in arithmetic operations.

3. BasicToken - A contract implementing the ERC20Basic interface and using SafeMath for arithmetic operations. It includes the transfer and balanceOf functions for transferring tokens and checking balances.

4. ERC20 - An interface extending ERC20Basic with additional functions for approving spending and allowing an address to spend tokens on behalf of another address.

5. StandardToken - A contract implementing the ERC20 interface and BasicToken. It includes the transferFrom, approve, allowance, increaseApproval, and decreaseApproval functions for handling token allowances and approvals.

6. Ownable - A contract defining ownership functionality, allowing the contract owner to transfer ownership to another address.

7. MintableToken - A contract implementing the minting functionality, allowing the owner to mint new tokens and finish minting.

You need to deploy this contract to create an ERC20 token with minting capabilities and ownership functionality.
